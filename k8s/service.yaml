# ==============================================================================
# Kubernetes Service
# ==============================================================================
# A Service provides a stable network endpoint for accessing pods.
# Pods are ephemeral (they come and go), but Services provide a consistent
# way to reach them through a stable IP and DNS name.
#
# Types of Services:
# - ClusterIP: Internal cluster access only (default)
# - NodePort: Exposes on each node's IP at a static port
# - LoadBalancer: Exposes externally using cloud load balancer
# ==============================================================================
